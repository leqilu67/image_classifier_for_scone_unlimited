# Deploy and monitor a machine learning workflow for Image Classification

In this project, we'll be building an image classification model that can automatically detect which kind of vehicle delivery drivers have, 
in order to route them to the correct loading bay and orders. Assigning delivery professionals who have a bicycle to nearby orders and giving 
motorcyclists orders that are farther can help Scones Unlimited optimize their operations. Weâ€™ll use AWS Sagemaker to build an image 
classification model that can tell bicycles apart from motorcycles. We'll deploy our model, use AWS Lambda functions to build supporting services, 
and AWS Step Functions to compose our model and services into an event-driven application.
